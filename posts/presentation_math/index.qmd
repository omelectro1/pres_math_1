# Preparation

## Choosing the data

As everyone always says,

> penguins are very cute!

...so let's work with penguin data today.  

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the palmerpenguins dataset is meant as an alternative to the commonly used iris data.

More information on this data set is available on [Allison Horst's Github page.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)  


This data can also be used via the {palmerpenguins} package [@Horst.2020] and was originally introduced in @Gorman.2014  


## Loading packages & reading data

First, we need to:  

::: {.incremental}  
1. load **packages**  
2. read in **data**  
3. check if that data is *in the right format*  
:::  

::: aside
By "right format", we mean that the data is tidy, and ready to be summarised and graphed.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
## Using the data without downloading it
This same dataset is also available in the package palmerpenguins.
:::
We've removed missing values here, which means that the data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows now[^1].


## Some descriptive statistics {.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Penguin species drawing by Allison Horst](pics/penguin_species.png){#fig-penguins}

![Explaining bill dimensions](pics/culmen_depth.png){#fig-bill}
:::


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
The average bill length is `r mean(penguins$bill_length_mm)` mm and the average bill depth is `r mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm)` mm.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The data was collected between `r min(penguins$year)` and `r max(penguins$year)`.

### Comparing base R and tidyverse syntax

Here's code to see data in a specific column:

::: {.panel-tabset}
#### base R
``` {.r}
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

#### tidyverse
``` {.r}
penguins %>% select(bill_length_mm)
```

:::


## Graphs

Some ideas for graphs:

- penguin weight by flipper length  
    - for the entire data  
    - or separately for each species  
    - and additionally by sex  
- flipper and bill length  
- bill length and depth

## Weight and flipper length

The following graphs are slightly simplified versions from the [vignette for the {palmerpenguins} package.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html)

Equation $x^2$

## dfjlkgd
\begin{equation*}
    a_n = \begin{cases}
              3n + 1  & \text{ if } n \text{ is odd} \\
              n / 2 & \text{ otherwise}
          \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{align*}
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 2 = 5
\end{align*}
